# Improve This Prompt

You will be given a prompt. Rewrite it to be clearer, safer, and more effective while preserving its original intent.

Original prompt:
```text
{{args}}
```

## What to Improve

1) Clarity & Specificity
- Remove ambiguity and undefined terms.
- Prefer concrete requirements and measurable constraints.

2) Context & Assumptions
- If critical context is missing, add a short “Assumptions” section and/or up to 5 clarifying questions.

3) Output Specification
- Specify an explicit output format (headings, bullet points, JSON schema, etc.) that matches the task.
- Specify desired depth (e.g., “3-5 bullets”, “one paragraph”, “include examples”).

4) Safety & Scope
- Add guardrails to avoid hallucinated claims and to ask for missing inputs.
- Prevent the model from inventing access to tools/files/network unless explicitly provided.

## Output (exact order)

1) Improved prompt (ready to copy/paste)
2) Change log (5-10 bullets, each bullet describes one improvement)
3) Clarifying questions (optional; only if needed)
