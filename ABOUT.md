# About HQE Workbench

## Mission

The **High Quality Engineering (HQE) Workbench** aims to democratize access to elite engineering leadership tools. By combining local static analysis with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we empower developers to maintain cleaner, safer, and more architecturally sound codebases—without sacrificing privacy.

## Vision

To build the "Jarvis" of software engineering: a proactive, intelligent, and secure assistant that lives on your machine, understands your entire codebase, and helps you make high-leverage technical decisions.

## Team

**Maintainer**: Faye Hakansdotter (GitHub: <https://github.com/AbstergoSweden>)

We are an open-source initiative driven by the belief that high-quality code is a right, not a privilege.
